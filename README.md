# Toast2018
Prac material and presentations from The Omics Australia Tutorials Sydney (TOAST) 2018 workshop about Nanopore sequencing.

The TOAST 2018 focusse on the introduction of Nanopore sequencing in two days: a lab day with hands-on sequencing and a bioinformatics tutorial including basecalling, read assembly and error correction.

## Day 1

After training on "dead" flow cell participants were prvided with DNA from 3 organisms and were asked to prepare a library using the 1D ligation kit SQK-LSK108 and subsequently sequence it on a Minion flow cell FLO-MIN106.


### Material

Presentations given by Tonia Russel (Ramaciotii Center for Genomics, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia) and Benjamin Schwessinger (Australian National University, Canberra, Australia) can be found int folder /day1/Presentations.

Handouts for lab practicals can be found in directory /day1/Handouts


## Day 2
Bioinformatics practical including the analysis of sequencing data from day1 as well as analysis and assembly of pre-compiled data including:
* base calling with albacore
* Plots using nanoplot
* extraction of reads using poretools and identification of the organisms sequenced on day1
* assembly with minimap2 & miniasm
* consensus building with Racon
* comparison to reference using mummer

### Material
Presentations can be found in directory /day2/presentations.

Handouts for the bioinformatics tutorial can be found in the directory /day2/handouts.

### Virtual machine

The Virtual machine for the course can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMEGsI7lB1hvA8QO5SEmtLrG47sRsIdS/view?usp=sharing

### Pre-compiled data

The pre-compiled data is included in the virtual machine but can also be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M1gdwoJUZJ4uOsk0Jm3Z1GvGMfc_aIYe/view?usp=sharing

### Day1 Sequencing data

# Introduction to Command-line
For course participants not yet familiar with command-line and linux I created a virtual machine and tutorial to get familiar with basic command-line usage.

## Virtual machine 
The CLI tutorial virtual machine, the tutorial and a video how to start the VM can be found in directory Commandline_tutorial at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rgUZBfh9RShS7P0QDYZ-qGCUeykJWUeD?usp=sharing
